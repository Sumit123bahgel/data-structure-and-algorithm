/*  Question :1 finding the missing number from a given array of integers like 0,1,3 so the output is 2 because 2 is missing in this array.  */
            //brute forse approach for finding the missing number
start
sort the given array
put a condition if element is not equal to zero than return zero i.e., the first element will always be zero after sorting otherwise it is missing.
put a for loop from 1 to n with condition that if(number-1!=number) than return number-1.
in last return last elment +1;
end.
            //Optimise solution for finding the missing number
start
initialize one variable with zero
and put a for loop from 0 to n
and xor all the elements with variable
return the variable
end.
